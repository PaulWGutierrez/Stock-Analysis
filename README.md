# Steve's 2017 and 2018 Stock-Analysis
## 1.) Overview of Project

#### The overview of the project was to help Steve with his parents investing into DAQO New Energy Corp stock. He was not sure if that was the right direction to put all of their investing into so he wanted to research other green energy stocks including DAQO. Within this research the yearly return between 2017 and 2018 will be calculated and Steve will verify if the return increased or decreased between those two years. During thisproject the Visual Basic for Applications "VBA" tool will be used to help Steve get solutions.

## 2.) Results

#### There are major differences between both years. Overall the majority of the stocks made positive returns in 2017 except for ticker "TERP". While in 2018 the majority of the stocks made a negative return except for tickers "ENPH" and "RUN", but "ENPH" still had a decrease in its return being 129.5% to 81.9%. While "RUN" made a major increase in its return being 5.5% to 84.0%.
